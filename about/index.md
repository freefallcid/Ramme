Hi there! My name is Dominic Reich and I live in a small place in [Tirol][tirol].

I'm an electrician but I currently work as a builder at a construction company.

From time to time I create small, helpful tools mostly written in Visual Basic. You find them in the projects collection - but beware: most of them are only
available in german ;-p

When I have some extra free time I like to take photos aswell.  
I own a Canon 450D for that. A few of my shots are available in the blog.

Whenever I need to write something down, I will do that in the notes category of the blog.  
I will use it mostly to remember myself to certain things - mostly tech related.
